# Daily Repository Activity Automation

## Overview

This repository contains a GitHub Actions automation system designed to maintain daily activity by making scheduled commits. The system is built around a simple workflow that appends timestamps to log files, ensuring consistent repository activity without adding unnecessary bloat.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Timezone: Indian Standard Time (IST) for all timestamps and scheduling.
Date completed: 2025-07-25 - Basic daily commit automation with IST timing configured.

## System Architecture

### Core Architecture
- **Automation Layer**: GitHub Actions workflow engine
- **Scheduling System**: Cron-based daily triggers (2:00 AM UTC)
- **Data Storage**: File-based logging system using simple text files
- **Version Control**: Git-based commit automation

### Technology Stack
- **CI/CD Platform**: GitHub Actions
- **Runtime Environment**: Ubuntu latest runner
- **File System**: Standard file operations for log management
- **Authentication**: Built-in GITHUB_TOKEN for repository access

## Key Components

### 1. Workflow Engine (`daily-commit.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates the daily commit automation
- **Trigger**: Time-based cron schedule (daily at 2:00 AM UTC)
- **Actions**: File manipulation, git operations, and repository updates
- **Permissions**: Read/write access to repository content

### 2. Logging System
- **Primary Log**: `logs/daily-activity.log` - Cumulative activity record
- **Status File**: `logs/last-update.txt` - Latest update timestamp
- **Directory Structure**: Organized under `/logs/` for easy management

### 3. Git Automation
- **Commit Strategy**: Minimal, timestamp-based changes
- **Branch Management**: Operates on main/default branch
- **Message Format**: Standardized commit messages for activity tracking

## Data Flow

1. **Scheduled Trigger**: GitHub Actions cron job activates daily
2. **Environment Setup**: Runner initializes with repository checkout
3. **Log Generation**: Current timestamp appended to activity logs
4. **File Updates**: Both cumulative and status files are updated
5. **Git Operations**: Changes are staged, committed, and pushed
6. **Completion**: Workflow concludes with success/failure status

## External Dependencies

### GitHub Services
- **GitHub Actions**: Core automation platform
- **GITHUB_TOKEN**: Built-in authentication mechanism
- **Git Infrastructure**: Version control and repository management

### Runtime Dependencies
- **Ubuntu Runner**: Provides execution environment
- **Git Client**: Pre-installed on GitHub runners
- **File System Access**: Standard POSIX file operations

## Deployment Strategy

### Setup Process
1. **Workflow Installation**: Place workflow file in `.github/workflows/`
2. **Permission Configuration**: Ensure read/write permissions are enabled
3. **Directory Creation**: Logs directory created automatically on first run
4. **Activation**: Workflow becomes active upon merge to main branch

### Maintenance Approach
- **Zero-maintenance**: Fully automated operation
- **Self-healing**: Creates necessary directories and files as needed
- **Minimal footprint**: Uses append-only operations to prevent bloat
- **Monitoring**: Built-in GitHub Actions logging and status reporting

### Customization Points
- **Schedule modification**: Cron expression can be adjusted
- **Log format changes**: Timestamp format and content customizable
- **File locations**: Log directory and file names configurable
- **Commit messages**: Message templates can be modified

The system prioritizes simplicity and reliability, avoiding complex dependencies while maintaining consistent repository activity through automated daily commits.
