# Daily Repository Activity Automation

This repository includes an automated GitHub Actions workflow that maintains daily activity by making small commits every day.

## How It Works

The workflow (`daily-commit.yml`) automatically:
- Runs every day at 2:00 AM UTC
- Appends the current timestamp to a log file
- Commits and pushes the change to keep the repository active
- Uses minimal changes to avoid repository bloat

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Add the Workflow File

1. Create the `.github/workflows/` directory in your repository if it doesn't exist
2. Copy the `daily-commit.yml` file to `.github/workflows/daily-commit.yml`
3. Commit and push the workflow file to your repository

### 2. Verify Permissions

The workflow uses the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` which should have sufficient permissions by default. If you encounter permission issues:

1. Go to your repository Settings → Actions → General
2. Under "Workflow permissions", ensure "Read and write permissions" is selected
3. Make sure "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" is checked if needed

### 3. Test the Workflow

You can manually trigger the workflow to test it:

1. Go to your repository's Actions tab
2. Select "Daily Repository Activity" from the workflows list
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Choose the branch and click "Run workflow"

### 4. Monitor Activity

- Check the `logs/` directory for generated activity files
- View workflow runs in the Actions tab
- Daily commits will appear in your repository's commit history

## Files Created

The workflow creates and maintains:
- `logs/daily-activity.log` - Cumulative log of all daily activities
- `logs/last-update.txt` - Shows the most recent update timestamp

## Customization Options

### Change Schedule
Modify the cron expression in the workflow file:
```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # 2:00 AM UTC daily
