# Daily Repository Activity Automation

🤖 **Complete automated solution for maintaining daily GitHub repository activity**

This repository contains everything you need to automatically keep your GitHub repository active with daily commits. Just copy this entire repository structure to your GitHub repo and it will start working immediately!

## 📋 What's Included

This complete package contains:
- ✅ **GitHub Actions workflow** (`.github/workflows/daily-commit.yml`)
- ✅ **Complete documentation** (this README)
- ✅ **Setup script** for easy installation
- ✅ **Log management system** (auto-creates `logs/` directory)

## 🚀 Quick Setup (Copy & Paste Ready)

### Method 1: Complete Repository Copy
1. **Download or clone this entire repository**
2. **Copy all files** to your target GitHub repository
3. **Commit and push** to your repository
4. **Done!** The workflow activates automatically

### Method 2: Manual File Copy
If you prefer to copy files individually:

1. **Copy the workflow file:**
   - Copy `.github/workflows/daily-commit.yml` to your repo
   
2. **Copy this README.md** (optional but recommended)

3. **Commit and push** the files

4. **Verify permissions** (see below)

## ⚙️ Permission Setup

After copying the files, ensure your repository has the right permissions:

1. Go to your repository **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**
2. Under "Workflow permissions":
   - Select **"Read and write permissions"**
   - Check **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**
3. **Save** the changes

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

Test that everything works:

1. Go to your repository's **Actions** tab
2. Find **"Daily Repository Activity"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"** button
4. Select your branch and click **"Run workflow"**
5. Watch it run successfully!

## 📊 What Happens Daily

Every day at 2:00 AM UTC, the workflow automatically:

1. **Wakes up** and checks out your repository
2. **Creates/updates** log files with current timestamp
3. **Commits** the changes with a descriptive message
4. **Pushes** to keep your repository active
5. **Reports** success in the Actions tab

## 📁 Files Created

The workflow creates and maintains:
- `logs/daily-activity.log` - Running log of all daily activities
- `logs/last-update.txt` - Most recent update timestamp

## 🛠️ Customization Options

### Change the Schedule
Edit the cron time in `.github/workflows/daily-commit.yml`:
```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # 2:00 AM UTC daily
```

Common alternatives:
- `'0 12 * * *'` - Noon UTC daily
- `'0 0 * * *'` - Midnight UTC daily
- `'0 6 * * 1-5'` - 6 AM UTC on weekdays only

### Change Commit Messages
Modify the commit message in the workflow file:
```yaml
git commit -m "🤖 Daily activity update - $TIMESTAMP"
```

### Change Log Location
Update the directory path in the workflow:
```bash
mkdir -p logs  # Change "logs" to your preferred directory
```

## 🔍 Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### Check if it's working:
- **Actions tab**: See workflow runs and their status
- **Commits**: Look for daily automated commits
- **Logs directory**: Check for updated files

### Common issues:
- **No commits appearing**: Check repository permissions
- **Workflow failing**: Review the Actions tab for error details
- **Wrong timezone**: Adjust the cron schedule

## 📈 Benefits

- ✅ **Minimal footprint** - Only adds timestamp entries
- ✅ **Reliable** - Uses GitHub's built-in infrastructure
- ✅ **Customizable** - Easy to modify schedule and behavior
